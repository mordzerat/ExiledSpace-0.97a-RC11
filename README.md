Mini-guide: Switching to Java 8 to prevent the post-battle slowdown
Help me help Alex by testing a new JRE 8.

Symptoms
After some time playing and immediately after a battle, the game FPS will plummet (eg from 60 to 15-25) and usually only go back to normal after a game restart.
Saving/loading takes 5x longer than usual.
Using at least one mod (that adds new sprites? incl. GraphicsLib).
Crash mentioning "PermGen space".

Instructions: (slow down and read this part carefully)

Windows users:
Go to your Starsector install and rename the jre folder to jre-backup.
Download (37 MB) https://github.com/wispborne/JRE/releases/download/jre8-362-azul/JRE_8_research.zip.
Extract that somewhere, then drag jre into your Starsector folder. You'll now have both jre (with java 8) and jre-backup.
See this image for the correct jre path: https://i.imgur.com/yZj5A1C.png
Replace your vmparams file with one of the ones included in the download, based on how much RAM you want to allocate (see ‚Å†troubleshooting to determine that, but don't download those files, they won't work for this JRE without -Xverify:none).OR edit your own vmparams file to add  -Xverify:none  (with spaces around it) immediately after java.exe (ie at the front).
Read the Potential Issues section below (your game+launcher may be zoomed in/off-center).
React with :bugdog: so we have an idea of how many people are testing.
Launch the game as normal.


Mac/Linux users:
Go here (https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=macos&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jre#zulu), 
 pick your Operating System, and download.
Follow the Windows steps above, but with the following changes:
2a. Rename the JRE folder you downloaded from the azul.com site.
   MacOS users: rename the new jre folder to Home. The one you need to replace is in Starsector.app/Contents (right-click Starsector and Show Package Contents).
   Linux users: rename the new jre folder to jre_linux and replace the existing one.
2b. Instead of editing/replacing vmparams, you will need to edit your .sh file. Easiest is to open it in an editor and copy another line with -X in it, paste it after the java.exe line, and edit it to -Xverify:none.

Potential issues
Game+launcher is zoomed in/off-center.
  This should no longer happen. Please let me know if it still does.

java.exe error message
  Do step 4 in the above instructions. If you're sure you have, make sure your antivirus didn't eat jre/bin/java.exe or jre/bin/javaw.exe.
